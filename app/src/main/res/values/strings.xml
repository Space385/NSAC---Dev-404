    <string name="Atom" tools:ignore="StringEscaping">The Atmospheric Tomography Mission (ATom) will study the impact of human-produced air pollution on greenhouse gases and on chemically reactive gases in the atmosphere. Reductions of atmospheric concentrations of methane (CH4), tropospheric ozone (O3) and black carbon (BC) aerosols are effective measures to slow global warming and to improve air quality. Airborne instruments will look at how atmospheric chemistry is transformed by various air pollutants and at the impact on CH4 and O3. Mitigation of these short-lived climate forcers is a major component of current international policy discussions.

ATom deploys an extensive gas and aerosol payload on the NASA DC-8 aircraft for systematic, global-scale sampling of the atmosphere, profiling continuously from 0.2 to 12 km altitude. Flights will occur in each of 4 seasons over a 4-year period. They will originate from the Armstrong Flight Research Center in Palmdale, California, fly north to the western Arctic, south to the South Pacific, east to the Atlantic, north to Greenland, and return to California across central North America. ATom establishes a single, contiguous global-scale data set. This comprehensive data set will be used to improve the representation of chemically reactive gases and short-lived climate forcers in global models of atmospheric chemistry and climate. Profiles of the reactive gases will also provide critical information for validation of satellite data, particularly in remote areas where in situ data is lacking.

ATom  s tomographic, large-scale sampling combined with parcel-by-parcel quantification of photochemical tendencies provides a strong response to the 2011 NASA Strategic Plan to Advance Earth System Science: meeting the challenges of climate and environmental change on a global scale.
ATom improves predictions of human-caused and natural changes in climate forcing and air quality over the entire globe, engaging the science Focus Areas: Atmospheric Composition (primary); Carbon Cycle and Ecosystems (role of CH4), and Climate Variability and Change (radiative forcing of CH4 and O3).

    <string name="ACRIMSAT"> The Earth weather and climate regime is determined by the total solar invariance (TSI) and its interactions with the Earth\ s atmosphere, oceans and landmasses. Evidence from both 34 years of direct satellite monitoring and historical proxy data leaves no doubt that solar luminosity in general, and TSI in particular, are intrinsically variable phenomena. Subtle variations of TSI resulting from periodic changes in the Earth\ s orbit (Milankovich cycles: ~20, 40 and 100 Kyrs) cause climate change ranging from major ice ages to the present inter-glacial, clearly demonstrating the dominance of TSI in climate change on long timescales. TSI monitoring, cosmogenic isotope analyses and correlative climate data indicate that variations of the TSI have been a significant climate forcing during the current inter-glacial period (the last ~ 10 Kyrs.). Phenomenological analyses of satellite TSI monitoring results, TSI proxies during the past 400 years and the records of surface temperature show that TSI variation has been the dominant forcing for climate change during the industrial era. The periodic character of the TSI record indicates that solar forcing of climate change will likely be the dominant variable contributor to climate change in the future.

A series of Active Cavity Radiometers (ACRs), a new generation of sensors with the precision required for compiling a long term TSI database for climate, were developed at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) of the California Institute of Technology under the direction of ACRIM Principal Investigator, Dr. Richard C. Willson. Their use in a series of Active Cavity Radiometer Irradiance Monitor (ACRIM) space flight experiments has provided a precise and traceable component of the TSI database during more than 90 % of its 34 year history. The ACRIM Science Team moved its operation to Columbia University in 1995 and then back to the Jet Propulsion Laboratory under contract in 2008. The ACRIM Instrument Team, directed by ACRIMSAT Program Manager Sandy Kwan, operates the ACRIMSAT satellite, ACRIM instrument  and ground telemetry instrumentation at JPL.

A contiguous TSI database of satellite observations extends from late 1978 to the present, covering more than three solar magnetic cycles. It\ s comprised of the observations of seven independent experiments: Nimbus7/ERB1, SMM/ACRIM12, ERBS/ERBE3, UARS/ACRIM24, SOHO/VIRGO5, ACRIMSAT/ACRIM36 and SORCE/TIM7. A composite database combining these results using overlapping, in-flight comparisons has begun to provide new insights into the variability of  total solar irradiance and its implications for climate change.

Monitoring TSI variability is clearly an important component of climate change research, particularly in the context of understanding the relative forcings of natural and anthropogenic processes. The requirements for a long-term, climate TSI database can be inferred from a National Research Council study which concluded that gradual variations in solar luminosity of as little as 0.1 % was the likely  forcing for the \ little ice age\  that persisted in varying degree from the late 14th to the mid 19th centuries. A centuries-long TSI database will have to be calibrated by either precision or accuracy to a small fraction of this value to be of use in assessing the magnitude of solar forcing. The current TSI database is shown in Figure 1.

Instrumentation used in spaceflight TSI monitoring to date has utilized sensors operating at ambient temperature (~ 20C). They provide the only practicable satellite instrument technology presently available for extended flight experiments. The \ native scale\ , on which the results of each experiment\ s TSI observations are reported, is based on the metrology of their individual cavity sensor properties in the International System of units (SI).

The de-facto, redundant, overlap TSI monitoring approach that has provided a contiguous record since 1978 resulted from the deployment of multiple, overlapping TSI satellite experiments. The traceability of this database is at the mutual precision level of overlapping experiments. This is typically orders of magnitude smaller than the \ absolute uncertainty  of observations in the international system of units (SI). ACRIM3 results have demonstrated a residual annual traceability of ~ 5 ppm during its 13 year mission. A carefully implemented redundant, overlap strategy should therefore be capable of producing a climate timescale (decades to centuries and longer) TSI record with useful traceability for assessing climate response to TSI variation.

• A redundant, overlapping TSI measurement strategy using existing ambient temperature instrumentation can provide the long term traceability required by a TSI database for climate change on climate time scales.

The state of the art measurement uncertainty for flight observations on an  absolute scale  in the international system of units (SI) has not been demonstrated to be significantly less than 1000 parts per million (ppm). The results of TSI monitoring experiments are reported on their  native scales  as defined in SI by the  self-calibration  features of their sensor technologies. Systematic uncertainties in the metrology used to relate their observations to SI caused the ± 0.25 % spread of results during the first decade of monitoring. The tighter clustering of results after 1990 is attributable to dissemination of more accurate sensor metrology among the various experiments and national standards labs.

A new approach to calibrating TSI sensors has been developed by several laboratories including Absolute Cryogenic Infrared Radiometry at the at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) LBIR facility and the TSI Radiometer Facility (TRF) at the Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics (LASP) of the University of Colorado. High powered lasers are calibrated in SI units using self-calibrating cryogenic irradiance detectors, similar in design to the self-calibrating ambient temperature sensors employed by satellite TSI monitors, but operated at LHe temperature. Self-calibrating irradiance sensors are thermal detectors that compare the heating effects of solar irradiance and electrical heating on a cavity detector. The uncertainty of their ability to define irradiance in SI units is temperature dependent. When cooled to LHe temperatures self-calibrating irradiance sensors can define irradiance at the 1 TSI level with uncertainties approaching a few hundred ppm. The calibrated lasers are used as transfer standards to irradiate ambient temperature satellite TSI sensors and compare their basic  self-calibrated  SI scales to that defined by the LHe cryogenic detector s. The effects of scattering and diffraction on sensor calibrations can also be determined by varying the beam size of the laser. The SI uncertainty of TRF calibrations can be on the order of 500 parts per million (ppm) or less, with the SI scale traceable to NIST. However, the ability of satellite TSI sensors to reproduce TRF calibrations on orbit has yet to be determined experimentally. The LASP TSI Radiometry Facility (TRF) has been used to calibrate TSI sensors equivalent to the SORCE/TIM, ACRIMSAT/ACRIM3 and SOHO/VIRGO satellite sensors. The results calibrate the basic scale of these sensors  operation in SI as well as the scattering and diffraction effects of their field-of-view defining instrumentation.

Preliminary LASP/TRF testing of ACRIM3 flight backup instrument found a net ~ 5000 ppm difference between ACRIM3 and the TRF cryo-radiometer defined SI scale caused by scattering (~ 3500 ppm), diffraction (~1200 ppm) and a basic SI scale difference (~300 ppm). Application of the TRF corrections to the ACRIM3 observations has resulted in close scale agreement with those of the SORCE/TIM experiment. Similar results have been obtained for the SOHO/VIRGO instrument. Additional testing is planned to decrease the uncertainties of the ACRIM3 results and apply the same type of TRF characterizations to the results of representative sensors of the SMM/ACRIM1 and UARS/ACRIM2 satellite instruments.

    <string name="ACTAmerica" tools:ignore="StringEscaping">ACT-America, or Atmospheric Carbon and Transport – America, will conduct five airborne campaigns across three regions in the eastern United States to study the transport and fluxes of atmospheric carbon dioxide and methane. Each 6-week campaign will measure how weather systems transport these greenhouse gases. The objective of the study is to enable more accurate and precise estimates of the sources and sinks of these gases. Better estimates of greenhouse gas sources and sinks are needed for climate management and for prediction of future climate. ACT America addresses three primary sources of uncertainty in our ability to infer carbon dioxide and methane sources and sinks – transport error, prior flux uncertainty and limited data density.

    <string name="ADEOS" tools:ignore="StringEscaping">The Advanced Earth Observing Satellite (ADEOS) was the first international space platform dedicated to Earth environmental research developed and managed by the National Space Development Agency of Japan (NASDA) (The Japanese call her MIDORI). The TOMS instrument along with NSCAT (a NASA Spectrometer designed to study wind speed and direction) were a major US components of the platform. ADEOS launched on August 17, 1996 (at 01:53 UT) into a Sun-synchronous sub-recurrent orbit of an altitude of approximately 830 km by an H-II launch vehicle from the Tanegashima Space Center.

    <string name="AIRMOSS" tools:ignore="StringEscaping">North American ecosystems are critical components of the global carbon cycle, exchanging large amounts of carbon dioxide and other gases with the atmosphere. Root-zone soil measurements can be used to better understand these carbon fluxes and their associated uncertainties on a continental scale. The goal of the Airborne Microwave Observatory of Subcanopy and Subsurface (AirMOSS) investigation was to provide high-resolution observations of root-zone soil moisture over regions representative of the major North American climatic habitats (biomes), quantify the impact of variations in soil moisture on the estimation of regional carbon fluxes, and extrapolate the reduced-uncertainty estimates of regional carbon fluxes to the continental scale of North America.

AirMOSS used an airborne ultra-high frequency synthetic aperture radar that has the capability to penetrate through substantial vegetation canopies and soil to depths down to approximately 1.2 meters. For AirMOSS, NASA’s Uninhabited Aerial Vehicle Synthetic Aperture Radar (UAVSAR) was flown on a Gulfstream-III aircraft. Extensive ground, tower, and aircraft in-situ measurements validated root-zone soil measurements and carbon flux model estimates. The surveys provided measurements at 100 meter spatial resolution and at sub-weekly, seasonal, and annual time scales.

AirMOSS responded directly to challenges set down by the NASA Carbon Cycle Science and the North American Carbon Program. Additionally, AirMOSS data provided a direct means for validating root-zone soil measurement algorithms from the Soil Moisture Active &amp; Passive (SMAP) mission and assessing the impact of fine-scale heterogeneities in its coarse-resolution products.

    <string name="AQUA" tools:ignore="StringEscaping">Aqua, Latin for water, is a NASA Earth Science satellite mission named for the large amount of information that the mission is collecting about the Earth\'s water cycle, including evaporation from the oceans, water vapor in the atmosphere, clouds, precipitation, soil moisture, sea ice, land ice, and snow cover on the land and ice. Additional variables also being measured by Aqua include radiative energy fluxes, aerosols, vegetation cover on the land, phytoplankton and dissolved organic matter in the oceans, and air, land, and water temperatures.

The Aqua mission is a part of the NASA-centered international Earth Observing System (EOS). Aqua was formerly named EOS PM, signifying its afternoon equatorial crossing time. A timeline of Aqua on-orbit progress through the initial 120 day check-out period can be found here.

Aqua was launched on May 4, 2002, and has six Earth-observing instruments on board, collecting a variety of global data sets. Aqua was originally developed for a six-year design life but has now far exceeded that original goal. It continues transmitting high-quality data from four of its six instruments, AIRS, AMSU, CERES, and MODIS, and reduced quality data from a fifth instrument, AMSR-E. The sixth Aqua instrument, HSB, collected approximately nine months of high quality data but failed in February 2003.

Aqua was the first member launched of a group of satellites termed the Afternoon Constellation, or sometimes the A-Train. The second member to be launched was Aura, in July 2004, the third member was PARASOL, in December 2004, and the fourth and fifth members are CloudSat and CALIPSO, in May 2006, and the sixth member was GCOM-W1 in May 2012. In December 2013, PARASOL completed its mission and exited the A-Train. The latest addition to the A-Train was OCO-2, launched in July 2014. Now complete, the A-Train is led by OCO-2, followed by GCOM-W1, then Aqua, CALIPSO, CloudSat and, in the rear, Aura.

    <string name="AQUARIUS" tools:ignore="StringEscaping">Salt. Most people view it first and foremost as the most common condiment. It comes in many forms and has thousands of uses, from preserving food to manufacturing pharmaceuticals. But salt also plays an important role in how the Earth system functions. And just as salt flows through our veins, it also flows through Earth\s ocean, the lifeblood of Earth\s climate system. The ocean is roughly 3.5% salt and the concentration of dissolved salts in the ocean is referred to as salinity, which varies across the globe and over time.
    Just as too much or too little salt in our diets affects our health, so too do high and low salinity have profound effects on how the ocean circulates, how freshwater cycles around Earth and how our climate works. The concentration of salt on the ocean surface — the part of the ocean that actively exchanges water and heat with Earth\s atmosphere — is a critical driver of ocean processes and climate variability.
        To better understand the regional and global processes that link variations in ocean salinity to changes in the global water cycle - and how these variations influence ocean circulation and climate - NASA built and launched Aquarius, the primary instrument aboard the international Aquarius/Satélite de Aplicaciones Científicas (SAC)-D observatory.
  Aquarius made NASAs first space-based global observations of ocean surface salinity, flying 657 kilometers (408 miles) above Earth in a sun-synchronous polar orbit that repeated every seven days. This NASA Earth System Science Pathfinder mission mapped global changes in ocean surface salinity with a resolution of 150 kilometers (93 miles), showing how salinity changes from month to month, season to season and year to year. Scientists are combining Aquarius data with in-water measurements to generate operational maps of ocean salinity distribution.
The Aquarius/SAC-D mission was developed collaboratively between NASA and Argentinas space agency, Commission National de Actividades Espaciales (CONAE) to best meet the goals of each agency while giving priority to salinity measurements. CONAE built complementary sensors to detect rain, sea ice, and wind speed, plus sea surface temperature sampling. CONAE-sponsored instruments — including sensors from the French Space Agency (Centre National dEtudes Spatiales, CNES) and another from the Italian Space Agency (Agenzia Spaziale Italiana, ASI) — provide environmental data for a wide range of applications, including natural hazards, land processes, epidemiological studies, and air quality issues.

    <string name="ATLAS" tools:ignore="StringEscaping">ATLAS-1, the first of the ATLAS series of Shuttle flights, was an important part of the long-term, coordinated research that made up NASA\ s Mission to Planet Earth. The ATLAS-1 solar science instruments and several of the atmospheric science instruments (MAS, ATMOS and SSBUV) flew on future ATLAS missions. Beyond its own science mission, a key goal of the ATLAS series was to provide calibration for NASA\ s Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite (UARS), launched from the Space Shuttle in September 1991. Two ATLAS-1 instruments, ACR and SUSIM, have direct counterparts aboard UARS, while other instruments aboard each mission were closely related. Repeated flights of the ATLAS instruments, which can be carefully calibrated before and after each flight, will allow for long-term calibration of UARS instruments.

This was the first of a series studying the Earth s atmosphere and the Sun s influence upon it over an entire 11-year solar cycle. ATLAS-1 experiments focused on four scientific disciplines: atmospheric science, solar science, space plasma physics and astronomy. By making simultaneous solar and atmospheric measurements on a global scale, scientists hope to unravel the complicated web of man s impact on the environment.

    <string name="ATS">The Applications Technology Satellite (ATS) series was conceived of as a follow-on to the successful experimental communications satellites of the early 1960\'s with the addition of other technology demonstrations, such as weather observation and investigation of the space environment.

NASA and Hughes had hoped to continue the success of the Syncom project with an Advanced Syncom. They met resistance from some members of Congress who feared that NASA was developing technology for the benefit of a private company, namely Comsat. So the project\'s objectives were broadened and it became ATS. The Department of Defense (DoD) influenced NASA to include technology for gravity-gradient stabilization (on ATS-2, ATS-4, and ATS-5) and for medium altitude orbits (ATS-2). All five of the first generation ATS spacecraft carried a C-band transponder with 25 MHz bandwidth capable of relaying 1200 one-way voice circuits or one color television signal.
